<h2>
New York City is one of the most hectic places on the planet. With a population of around eight million, traffic is a nightmare. From 2017-2022 there were 314,676 injuries caused by motor vehicle accidents. That's about 143 injuries per day. Fortunately for New Yorkers, that number is steadily decreasing.  
</h2>

<p>	From 2017 - 2019 there were 183,986 reported injuries from motor vehicle accidents, but from 2020-2022 that number dropped to 130,690, a 29% decrease. The drastic drop in injuries can be attributed to countless factors. However, there are three that stand out from the rest.

<h3><b>Covid Pandemic</b></h3>



<p>January 10, 2020, marked the beginning of the Covid-19 pandemic.The virus made its way across the world, resulting in the deaths of over a million people. Each state had implemented its own laws and regulations to stop the spread of the virus. There were states like Florida that went about the pandemic as if it didn't exist. Then there was New York and the Big Apple. Public schools shut down on March 16, 2020, and on March 22, Governor Cuomo required all non-essential businesses to shut down temporarily. The most populated city in the U.S. had turned into a ghost town. </p>

<p>Although vaccines for the virus have been developed and the regulations have been lifted, some individuals are still afraid to go out due to the risk of getting the virus. Iris Wenig, 80, says she is still worried about catching the virus.</p>

<p>"What happens is there's a new strain called Arcturus, so I still don't feel safe going into crowded places, even around family and friends," Wenig said.</p>

<p>Covid may have been the primary influence in driving down the number of motor vehicle injuries. However, there are still other factors to consider. 
</p>

<h3><b>New York State Government</b></h3>
	
	

<p>Over the years, the government has implemented more safety features to help with the city's traffic surge. One notable feature is the addition of more protected bike lanes in Manhattan. Driving through the streets of NYC is a hardship on its own, but it takes guts to ride a bike through the busy streets of Manhattan. Former New York City resident, Nick Crocco, says he felt uncomfortable riding his bike during his time in the city.
</p>

<p>"People drive like animals in the city, there's too much going on and, it makes me nervous," Crocco said.</p>

<p>	
Fortunately, the problem is being handled. NYC Mayor Eric Adams reported that by 2026 Manhattan will have 50 miles of protected bike lanes. The project has already begun, with 32 miles of protected bike lanes installed last year.

<h3><b>Advancements in Automobile Technology</b></h3>


<p>Every year we see improvements in motor vehicle technology that make driving safer. Yet, in recent years car safety technology has reached new heights. 
</p>

<p>Tesla has become the car of the future with its state-of-the-art autopilot system, and the feature is not just for show. According to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, the latest Model S received a <a href="https://www.tesla.com/blog/model-s-receives-5-star-euro-ncap-safety-rating#:~:text=Following%20this%20test%2C%20Model%20S,91%25%20in%20Child%20Occupant%20Protection."target="_blank"> 5-star safety rating</a> in every category. The autopilot system is not yet fully autonomous. Still, Tesla CEO Elon Musk claimed on Twitter that Tesla will have a fully autonomous car available sometime in 2023. </p>

<p>The autopilot safety feature is only available for certain cars. However, other vital safety features have become mandatory for every car manufacturer. The backup camera, for instance, was declared mandatory for all new vehicles back in 2018.</p>

<p>In addition, any car manufactured after 2023 is required to have an auto emergency brake function. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/9/29/23377376/automatic-emergency-braking-average-speed-study-aaa#:~:text=The%20Insurance%20Institute%20for%20Highway,vehicles%20nearly%2020%20years%20ago." target="_blank"> The Insurance Institute for Highway Safety </a> believes the mandate has the potential to prevent 28,000 crashes and 12,000 injuries by 2025.</p>

<h3><b>Takeaways and Limitations</b></h3>

<div>
	

<p>For most of my analysis, I faced very few limitations. There are a few details, though, that I wish the NYPD had provided. </p>

<p> First, I wish the data provided more details about the type of car involved in the crash. Finding a crash trend for a certain car company could have raised some major concerns. In addition, the year of the vehicle would be helpful because there could possibly be a higher rate of crashes involving older cars. The last limitation was simply the amount of missing information in the dataset. Still, the data revealed numerous helpful trends about New York City traffic. </p>

<p> The importance of motor vehicle safety can't go unnoticed. The focus of this study may have just been on New York City, but crashes take the lives of thousands every day throughout the world. According to the <a href= "https://www.cdc.gov/injury/features/global-road-safety/index.htmlgovernment,3700" target="_blank"> government</a>, 3700 people die daily from motor vehicle accidents.</p> 

<p> Hopefully, over the next few decades, with the increasing advancements in automobile technology and help from the government, the decreasing trend in motor vehicle accidents will continue to the point where you can count the number of accidents per year on your fingers.
