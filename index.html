		Last year in all five NYC boroughs, from August 30 to December 24, there were over 900 motor accidents. </p>
		<p> New York City is a nightmare when it comes to traffic issues. Crashes happen all the time so I wanted to take a deeper dive into the analystics behind the problem.  </p>
		<p>I discovered that out of the 986 crashes that took place during the time frame, there were suprisingly only 4 deaths. It is amazing to see the technological advancements that car manufacturers have made over the years. </p>

I'm still having trouble uploading my dataviz for some reason, I uploaded my image to the same folder as one.html but its still not working. My dataviz is a circle with a bunch of stick figures in it to demonstrate all the people that were in motor accidents. The 4 stick figures in green are the people that died.
